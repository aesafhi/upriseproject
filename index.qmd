Transforming Dredged Sediments into Tomorrow’s Infrastructure.

Unlocking the Potential of Dredged Sediments for Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructure (UP-RISE) is a research project funded by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowship under the Horizon Europe programme (Project No. 101129741). It is hosted by Østfold University College (Norway), co-supervised by OsloMet, and developed in collaboration with the industrial partner NETICS (Netherlands).

UP-RISE is dedicated to pioneering sustainable, circular solutions for the reuse of dredged sediments in civil engineering. By converting these underutilized materials into high-performance, low-carbon construction components, the project supports the transition toward climate-resilient infrastructure and aligns with the EU Green Deal and global sustainability goals.

Through interdisciplinary research, experimental development, and industry collaboration, UP-RISE explores innovative binders, performance optimization, and real-world applications of sediment-based materials.
